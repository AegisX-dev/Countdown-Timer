# Overview

This is a web-based Countdown Timer application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to create multiple timers, set target dates and times, and manage them with start, 
stop, reset, and delete functionalities. The application features a sleek, modern design with a responsive layout and audio notifications when timers complete.

Customizable Timer Names: Assign names to each timer for easy identification.

Countdown Display: Shows days, hours, minutes, and seconds remaining.

Controls: Start, stop, reset, and delete timers with intuitive buttons.

Audio Notification: Plays a beep sound (3 times with a 500ms delay) when a timer reaches zero.

Responsive Design: Adapts to various screen sizes, including mobile devices.

Visual Feedback: Displays messages for actions like pausing, resetting, or invalid inputs.

Modern Styling: Uses a glassmorphism-inspired design with a blurred background and smooth animations.

When a timer reaches zero, a "Timeâ€™s Up!" message is shown, and the beep sound plays.



## Technical Details

HTML:
Uses semantic HTML5 with a single-page structure.

CSS:
Utilizes CSS variables for consistent theming.
Implements glassmorphism with backdrop-filter: blur.
Includes responsive design with media queries for smaller screens.
Features animations like fadeIn and pulse for visual feedback.

JavaScript:
Manages timer logic with setInterval for real-time updates.
Handles dynamic creation of timers via DOM manipulation.
Includes a utility to play the beep sound multiple times with delays.
Stores timer state (e.g., interval IDs) to prevent conflicts.


# Dependencies:

Google Fonts: Poppins (loaded via CDN).
No external JavaScript libraries; pure vanilla JavaScript.



# Known Limitations

Past Dates: If a target time is in the past, the timer counts down to zero immediately with a warning message.

Audio Playback: Audio may fail to play in some browsers due to autoplay restrictions; errors are logged to the console.

Browser Compatibility: Best supported in modern browsers. Some older browsers may not support backdrop-filter or certain input types.

# Future Improvements

Add persistent storage (e.g., localStorage) to save timers across sessions.

Allow customization of timer sounds or themes.

Implement a snooze feature for completed timers.

Enhance accessibility with ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation.
